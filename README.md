# Updated Portfolio
This week's assignment required me to update my personal portfolio. I 
used a free bootstrap template prior to adding in my most recent featured works. This template
consisted more of html than js and css combined. A screenshot showing the initial layout of my portfolio can
be found below.
The following requirements are to be met based off the given criteria: 

## Homework Requirements

* Updated portfolio featuring Project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments.

* Updated GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring Project 1 and two exemplary assignments.

* Updated resume

* Updated LinkedIn profile
